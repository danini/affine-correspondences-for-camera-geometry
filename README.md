# Making Affine Correspondences Work in Camera Geometry Computation

The framework proposed in paper: `Barath, Daniel, et al. Making Affine Correspondences Work in Camera Geometry Computation. ECCV 2020`.
It is available at https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123560698.pdf

# Installation C++

To build and install only the C++ implementation of the framework, clone or download this repository and then build the project by CMAKE. 
```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/danini/affine-correspondences-for-camera-geometry.git
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

# Install Python package and compile C++

The framework contains a Python binding and Jupyter Notebook examples. To compile with Python the following should be done.

```bash
python3 ./setup.py install
```

or

```bash
pip3 install -e .
```

# Example project

To build the sample project showing examples of fundamental matrix, homography and essential matrix fitting, set variable `CREATE_SAMPLE_PROJECT = ON` when creating the project in CMAKE. 
Then 
```shell
$ cd build
$ ./SampleProject
```

# Jupyter Notebook example

The example for homography fitting is available at: [link][example3].
 
The example for fundamental matrix fitting is available at: [link][example2].

The example for essential matrix fitting is available at: [link][example1].
